<h1>Golden Rules</h1>

<p>Here are some rules that we follow when developing jMock:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Test Driven:</b> Never check in a class without associated unit
    tests.</li>
  <li><b>Unit Tests Always Pass:</b> Never check a failing unit test into the
    CVS repository.</li>
  <li><b>Acceptance Tests Can Fail:</b> A failing acceptance test indicates
    something that needs to be done: a todo item, feature request or bug
    report, for example. It's ok to check a failing acceptance test into the
    CVS repository.</li>
  <li><b>Separate Acceptance and Unit Tests:</b> Make it easy to run only the
    unit tests so that we can check that they pass before committing, even
    when acceptance tests are failing.</li>
</ul>
