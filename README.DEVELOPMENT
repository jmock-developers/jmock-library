Development rules
=================

Here are some rules that we follow when developing jMock:

 * Never check in a class without associated unit tests.

 * Never check a failing unit test into the repository.

 * Acceptance tests may fail. A failing acceptance test indicates
   something that needs to be done: a todo item, feature request or
   bug report, for example. It's ok to check a failing acceptance test
   into the repository.

 * Separate acceptance  and unit tests. Make  it easy to  run only the
   unit tests so that we can check that they pass before committing,
   even when acceptance tests are failing.

 * Resolve and remove all TODO comments before checking in.

 * Avoid the following words in class names and other identifiers:
   Helper, Impl (or a derivative), Manager.

 * And the reverse: don't start interfaces with an I.

 * Use the TestDox naming conventions for unit tests.


Architectural Constraints
=========================

* No dependency on any specific test framework.

That means, don't use JUnit Assert.assertBlahBlah to check expectations.
Throw ExpectationError to report a violated expectation.
Throw some kind of RuntimeException to report programming errors in the
use of the framework.  E.g. trying to set up an expectation to return a 
result of the wrong type.
