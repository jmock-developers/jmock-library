<h2><a href="oopsla2006.pdf">Evolving an Embedded Domain-Specific Language in
Java</a></h2>

<p>Steve Freeman, Nat Pryce</p>

<p>In Proc. OOPSLA 2006</p>

<p>This paper describes the experience of evolving a domain-specific language
embedded in Java over several generations of the jMock test framework. We
describe how the framework changed from a library of classes to an embedded
language. We describe the lessons we have learned from this experience for
framework developers and language designers.</p>

<h2><a href="oopsla2004.pdf">Mock Roles, Not Objects</a></h2>

<p>Steve Freeman, Nat Pryce, Tim Mackinnon, Joe Walnes</p>

<p>In Proc. OOPSLA 2004</p>

<p>Mock Objects is an extension to Test-Driven Development that supports good
Object-Oriented design by guiding the discovery of a coherent system of types
within a code base. It turns out to be less interesting as a technique for
isolating tests from third-party libraries than is widely thought. This paper
describes the process of using Mock Objects with an extended example and
reports best and worst practices gained from experience of applying the
process. It also introduces jMock, a Java framework that embodies our
collective experience. </p>

<h2><a href="yoga.html">jMock: Yoga for your Unit Test</a></h2>

<p>Nat Pryce</p>

<p>Brittle tests are a common "gotcha" of test driven development. A brittle
unit test will stop passing when you make unrelated changes to your
application code. A test suite that contains a lot of brittle tests will slow
down development and inhibit refactoring. A brittle test overspecifies the
behaviour of the unit being tested. You can keep your tests flexible by
following a simple rule of thumb: specify exactly what you want to happen
<em>and no more</em>. This article describes how various features of jMock
can help you strike the right balance between an accurate specification of a
unit's required behaviour and a flexible test that allows easy evolution of
the code base.</p>
