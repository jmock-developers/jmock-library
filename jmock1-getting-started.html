    <h1>jMock 1: Getting Started</h1>

    <p>This guide assumes you are familiar with unit-testing and <a
    href="http://junit.org/">JUnit</a>.</p>

    <p>For a simple example we are going to test a publish/subscribe message
    system. A Publisher sends objects to zero or more Subscribers. We want to
    test the Publisher, which involves testing its interactions with its
    Subscribers.</p>

    <p>The Subscriber interface looks like this:</p>

    <div class="Source Java"><pre>interface Subscriber {
    void receive(String message);
}</pre></div>

    <p>We will test that a Publisher sends a message to a single registered
    Subscriber. To test interactions between the Publisher and the Subscriber
    we will use a mock Subscriber object.</p>

    <p>First we must import the jMock classes, define our test fixture class
    and define a test case method.</p>

    <div class="Source Java"><pre>import org.jmock.*;

class PublisherTest extends MockObjectTestCase {
    public void testOneSubscriberReceivesAMessage() {
    }
}</pre></div>

    <p>We will now write the body of the
    <code>testOneSubscriberReceivesAMessage</code> method.</p>

    <p>We first <i>set up</i> the context in which our test will execute. We
    create a Publisher to test. We create a mock Subscriber that should
    receive the message. We then register the Subscriber with the Publisher.
    Finally we create a message object to publish.</p>

    <div class="Source Java"><pre>Mock mockSubscriber = mock(Subscriber.class);
Publisher publisher = new Publisher();
publisher.add( (Subscriber)mockSubscriber.proxy() );

final String message = "message";</pre></div>

    <p>Next we define <i>expectations</i> on the mock Subscriber that specify
    the methods that we expect to be called upon it during the test run. We
    expect the receive method to be called with a single argument, the message
    that will be sent. The <code>eq</code> method is defined in the
    MockObjectTestCase class and specifies a "<a
    href="jmock1-constraints.html">constraint</a>" on the value of the
    argument passed to the subscriber: we expect the argument to be the equal
    to the <var>message</var>, but not necessarily the same object. (jMock
    provides <a href="jmock1-constraints.html">several constraint types</a>
    that can be used to precisely specify expected argument values). We don't
    need to specify what will be returned from the receive method because it
    has a void return type.</p>

    <div class="Source Java"><pre>mockSubscriber.expects(once()).method("receive").with( eq(message) );</pre></div>

    <p>We then <i>execute</i> the code that we want to test.</p>

    <div class="Source Java"><pre>publisher.publish(message);</pre></div>

    <p>After the test has finished, jMock will <i>verify</i> that the mock
    Subscriber was called as expected. If the expected calls were not made,
    the test will fail.</p>

    <p>Here is the complete test.</p>

    <div class="Source Java"><pre>import org.jmock.*;

class PublisherTest extends MockObjectTestCase {
    public void testOneSubscriberReceivesAMessage() {
        // set up
        Mock mockSubscriber = mock(Subscriber.class);
        Publisher publisher = new Publisher();
        publisher.add((Subscriber) mockSubscriber.proxy());
        
        final String message = "message";
        
        // expectations
        mockSubscriber.expects(once()).method("receive").with( eq(message) );
        
        // execute
        publisher.publish(message);
    }
}</pre></div>

    <p>That concludes this quick introduction. More advanced topics are
    covered in <a href="jmock1.html">other tutorials</a>.</p>
