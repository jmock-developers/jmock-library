/**
 * Implementation of a thread-safe {@link Executor} that runs an exact number of
 * commands, that is, it expects that a predefined number of commands are
 * supplied to it. Executing that number of commands is also the termination
 * criteria.<br />
 * <br />
 * Only supplying a command to this executor will not run them. In order to run
 * commands, the method {@link #waitForExpectedTasks()} has to be invoked.<br />
 * <br />
 * One difference between this Executor and {@link DeterministicExecutor} is
 * that if you have one thread executing commands with this executor and 
 * you're waiting in the JUnit test for all commands to be executed. What could
 * happen, however, is that the runUntilIdle method returns before the other
 * command were even queued to be executed. This executor solves exactly this
 * problem: it makes sure all expected commands get executed.
