    <h1>Scripting Custom Actions</h1>

    <p>Using a <a href="custom-actions.html">custom action</a> in an
    expectation is straightforward but requires quite a lot of code. You need
    to define a class that implements the action and a factory method to make
    the expectation read clearly. The jMock Scripting Extension lets you
    define custom actions inline in the expectation, as <a
    href="http://www.beanshell.org/">BeanShell</a> scripts.</p>

    <div class="Note Warning"><p>Because a script is represented as a string,
    it does not play well with refactoring tools.</p></div>

    <p>First, you need to add the following JARs to your classpath:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>jmock-script-<span class="Version 2">2.x.x</span>.jar</li>

      <li>bsh-core-2.0b4.jar</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Second, you need to import the "perform" factory method into your
    test.</p>

    <pre class="Java Source">import static org.jmock.lib.script.ScriptedCallbackAction.perform;</pre>

    <p>You can then use the "perform" factory method to define custom actions
    using a BeanShell script. The script can refer to the parameters of the
    mocked method by the names <var>$0</var> (the first parameter),
    <var>$1</var>, <var>$2</var>, etc. For example, the script below calls
    back to a Runnable passed as the first (and only) parameter:</p>

    <pre class="Java Source">checking(new Expectations() {{
    oneOf (executor).execute(with(a(Runnable.class))); will(perform("$0.run()"));
}}</pre>

    <p>A script can pass literal values as parameters to the callback. For
    example, the script below adds an integer to a collection:</p>

    <pre class="Java Source">checking(new Expectations() {{
    oneOf (collector).collect(with(a(Collection.class))); will(perform("$0.add(2)"));
}}</pre>

    <p>If you want a script to refer to an object defined by the test, you
    will have to define a script variable with a "where" clause. Any number of
    where clauses can be appended onto the perform clause to define
    variables. For example, to translate the code from the <a
    href="custom-actions.html">custom action recipe</a> to use a BeanShell
    script, we must define a script variable for the list of mangoes to be
    added to the collection:</p>

    <pre class="Java Source">final FruitTree mangoTree = mock(FruitTree.class);
final Mango mango1 = new Mango();
final Mango mango2 = new Mango();

context.checking(new Expectations() {{
    oneOf (mangoTree).pickFruit(with(a(Collection.class))); will(perform("$0.addAll(mangoes)")
            .where("mangoes", Arrays.asList(mango1, mango2));
}});

...</pre>
