    <h1>jMock 1: Stubs, Expectations and the Dispatch of Mocked Methods</h1>

    <p>In jMock, stubs and expectations are basically the same thing. A stub
    is just an expectation of zero or more invocations. The
    <code>stubs()</code> method is syntactic sugar to make the intent of the
    test more explicit.</p>

    <p>When a method is invoked on a mock object, the mock object searches
    through its expectations from newest to oldest to find one that matches
    the invocation. After the invocation, the matching expectation might stop
    matching further invocations. For example, an <code>expects(once())</code>
    expectation only matches once and will be ignored on future invocations
    while an <code>expects(atLeastOnce())</code> expectation will always be
    matched against invocations.</p>

    <p>This scheme allows you to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Set up default stubs in your the <code>setUp</code> method of your
      test class and override some of those stubs in individual tests.</li>

      <li>Set up different "once" expectations for the same method with
      different action per invocation. However, it's better to use the
      <code>onConsecutiveCalls</code> method to do this, as described
      below.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>However, there are some possible "gotchas" caused by this scheme:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>if you create an expectation and then a stub for the same method,
      the stub will always override the expectation and the expectation will
      never be met.</li>

      <li>if you create a stub and then an expectation for the same method,
      the expectation will match, and when it stops matching the stub will be
      used instead, possibly masking test failures.</li>

      <li>if you create different expectations for the same method, they will
      be invoked in the opposite order than that in which they were specified,
      rather than the same order.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The best thing to do is <em>not</em> set up multiple expectations and
    stubs for the same method with exactly the same matchers. Instead, use the
    <tt><code>onConsecutiveCalls</code></tt> method to create multiple actions
    for a method. For example:</p>

    <div class="Java Source"><pre>mock.expects(atLeastOnce()).method(m).with(...)
   .will( onConsecutiveCalls(
       returnValue(10),
       returnValue(20),
       throwException(new IOException("end of stream")) ) );</pre></div>

    <p>If you want to specify more complex ordering or order invocations
    across different mock objects, use the <code>after</code> method to
    explicitly define a total or partial ordering of invocations.</p>
